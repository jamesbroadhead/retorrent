Retorrent is a media management and re-seeding tool.

It renames media files from their original filenames to ones that are systematic and easy to organise, into a format compatible with the default filename parsers which come with the XBMC Media Centre.

The initial retorrent code comes from a time where I was still learning python, and so some elements of it do not work as well as they might. Contributions and/or advice are welcome.

Some of this code comes from publically accessible code, which may not be covered by the blanket GPL, as the rest of the code in this project is. These sections are commented and attributed, please refer to the attribution for licensing details.

New Torrent Workflow:
	Download a .torrent file using your browser.
	Put the .torrent file in your TORRENTFILESDIR
	Allow your torrent client to download the content to your TORRENTDIR (TORRENTDIR != TORRENTFILESDIR)
	Use retorrent to move the content to a media directory. Appropriate symlinks are created in SEEDDIR, and the .torrent file is moved to SEEDTORRENTFILESDIR
	Use symlinker to create symlinks between the media directories and the central media repository (the directory scanned by your media center).
	(Use the content as you see fit)

Removing a Torrent Workflow:
	Determine if content file foo.mkv is seeded using is_seeded.py
	If you still want to remove it, remove all the child symlinks using remreffer
