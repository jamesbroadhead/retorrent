See http://code.google.com/p/jamesbroadhead/ for general project details. 

These are scripts written for my own convenience that I thought may be useful to others (and I don't believe in posting them on a blog, where they can stagnate).

Please submit Bug Reports if you use these and encounter any. Patches are always welcome. 

Coding Guidelines:
	Generally laissez-faire, but I require 4-space-width TAB characters to be used for indentation

Copyright and Licensing:
	Unless otherwise noted, all code under this repository is:
	Copyright 2009,2010 James Broadhead and Licenced under the GPL v3, as available on gnu.org.
	If you require any of these tools for some purpose, and require them re-licensed, I am open to suggestions and offers.
