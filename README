See http://code.google.com/p/jamesbroadhead/ for general project details. 

ReTorrent is a set of python scripts to manage the moving,renaming and seeding of torrents-content through the creation of symlinks. There are other scripts available here which were written for my own convenience, but which I thought might be useful to others (and I don't believe in posting them on a blog, where they can stagnate). 

Please submit Bug Reports if you use these and encounter any. Patches are always welcome. For the best legibility, I suggest that you use 4-space-width TAB characters. It is such a shame that modelines are a security hole.
