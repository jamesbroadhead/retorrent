Goal: Less code in episoder.py
Goal: Cleaner separation of concerns
Goal: Caching of optionator results (generically, ideally)
Goal: Less mutating state


WIP:
  - mostly separated concerns. Need to clean up, figure out domain for each class
    => the formatter should probably own the digits_in_epno:w

  - need to figure out interim caching & generic caching

  - EpnoFormatter.format should be a classmethod - this may be tricky (memoization may help?)
